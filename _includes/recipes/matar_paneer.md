- Put the small pan on the heat and add oil into it. Once the oil is heated, add paneer to it and fry until golden. Be careful while putting paneer into oil, it may splash the oil.
- Put a pan on the hob on medium to high, and add 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon Clarified butter to the pan.
- Once the oil and butter are heated, add onion into the pan. Keep stirring until onions are soft and golden. Let onion become a little crispy or burned. It will take approximately 4 to 5 minutes.
- Use a hand blender to blend onion a bit, do not make a fine paste. (optional step)
- Add tomatoes into the pan and cook until completely disappear in the curry. It will take approximately 3 to 4 minutes.
- Now add peas into the pan and cook with the lid on. Stir occasionally.
- Add the spice mix into the curry and cook for some time, until it is cooked nicely.
- Add 1 tablespoon yoghurt and mix properly. Cook for a few seconds and then add 3 tablespoons of hot water into it. Cook for a few minutes.
- Add paneer into the pan and mix properly. Add half a cup of hot water and cook for some time with lid one.
- Add plain bhujia powder into the curry. If the curry looks too thick then add a bit more hot water. Cook on low heat for some time.
- Add 1 tablespoon cream into the curry and stir well. Keep cooking on low heat for 1-2 minutes. Make sure curry is not too thick. If it is too thick then add a bit of hot water.
- Take fenugreek leaves in your palm and rub them nicely, put it inside the curry. Cook for 1 minute with the lid on.
- Remove the pan from heat and enjoy the curry with rice, naan or flatbread.
