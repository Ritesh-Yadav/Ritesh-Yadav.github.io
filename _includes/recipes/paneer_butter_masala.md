## Pro Tip

You can use chicken instead of paneer to make butter chicken. You might want to roast the chicken before putting into the gravy.

## Steps

- Cut onion in 6 halves. No need to chop finely.
- Cut tomatoes in 4 halves.
- Put a pan on the hob on medium to high, and add 1 tablespoon butter to the pan. Stir the butter with a spatula and let it melt. Make sure that butter does not burn.
- Once the butter is melted, add onion, tomatoes and cashews in the pan. Keep stirring until tomatoes and onions are soft. Tomatoes and onions need to be softened not fully cooked. It will take approximately 3 to 4 minutes.
- Once onions and tomatoes are soft then take those out into the wide bowl. Keep them aside to cool down.
- Now put the pan off the hob. Cut paneer into cubes of a half centimetre to 1 centimetre.
- If you are using very soft paneer like Apertina then skip this step, else continue. Put a pan on the medium heat. Add half tablespoon butter in the pan. Once butter is melted, add paneer to it. Stir occasionally and make sure paneer does not turn golden. Once the paneer is soft and squishy. Take paneer out of the pan in a bowl. 
- When the tomato, onion and cashew mixture is cool down, then put it into the blender and make a silky smooth puree.
- Put the puree through the sieve. Remove all the chunks and tomato skin.
- Put the pan on the medium heat and add 1 to 2 tablespoon butter into the pan. Once butter is melted, add the puree into the pan. Be very careful because the puree will start splashing. Keep stirring and make sure puree does not stick to the pan. Cook for 1 minute with the lid on and stir occasionally.
- Add 1 tablespoon Kashmiri chilli powder and 1 tablespoon Garam masala. You can reduce chilli if you do not have Kashmiri chilli powder. You can also use less garam masala if you prefer. However, add at least half a tablespoon. Continue stir and put the lid on. Cook for approximately 2 minutes with the lid on and stir occasionally.
- Add half cup water approximately 130 ml water and mix well. Cook for 1 minute and add paneer into the gravy.
- Put the lid on and continue cooking for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir occasionally and make sure curry does not stick to the pan.
- Add 1 to 2 tablespoon of honey as per your taste. This curry is a bit on the sweeter side. Honey is to reduce the tangy flavour of the tomatoes. Cook for 1 minute with the lid on and stir occasionally. If you do not have honey then you can use sugar.
- Add 1 tablespoon cream into the curry and stir well.
- Add red food color as per your need and stir well.
- Take fenugreek leaves in your palm and rub nicely, put it inside the curry. Cook for 1 minute with the lid on.
- Remove the pan from heat and enjoy the curry with rice, naan or flatbread.
